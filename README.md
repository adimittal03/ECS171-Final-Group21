Abstract: In 2023, the U.S. jewelry market was valued at 73.32 billion USD, with diamonds comprising a significant share. Predicting diamond prices accurately is essential for jewelers to make informed pricing decisions. This paper explores various machine learning algorithms, including linear regression, Random Forests, XGBoost, and neural networks, to predict diamond prices based on characteristics such as carat, cut, color, and clarity. Through exploratory data analysis, we identify key features influencing diamond prices and apply these insights to improve model performance. Our methodology includes rigorous model evaluation using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and R-squared (RÂ²). By developing a robust predictive model, we aim to enhance pricing precision, benefiting both businesses and consumers in the diamond market.
